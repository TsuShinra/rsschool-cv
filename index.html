                   <li><strong>Name:</strong> Alisa Pykhova</li>
                   <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> email: apykhova@gmail.com; mobile/telegram: +79312066110; Skype:tsumiri</li>
                   <li><strong>Summary:</strong> Last year I've desided that there is a need for change, so I chose to take a new
                     step and become a Front-End developer. This is what amuses me in front-end: you can see the result of your 
                     work as soon as you fix or change it. Although my Back-End developer-friends say that 'moving pixels' 
                     around is quite boring, I am never bored with this process. It encourages me to learn more and more every 
                     day.</li>
                   <li><strong>Skills:</strong> basic HTM/CSS skills, including Flexbox and Grid, basic JS skills, basic Flutter knowledge</li>
                   <li><strong>Code example:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/TsuShinra/html_course_1/">HTML page example</a>
                    <a href="https://github.com/TsuShinra/Test_project_for_Leonid/">Flutter code example</a></li>
                   <li><strong>Experience:</strong> HTML course project and several layouts I did for fun for my hobby projects</li>
                   <li><strong>Education:</strong>  Got admitted to Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics in 2003, 
                    dropped after 1 year, transfering to Sociology faculty, which I succesfully graduated in 2009. 
                    After that was working mainly in localization industry, in LogrusIT LLC. Now I plan to move on and return 
                    to my long-forgotten programming dreams.</li>
                   <li><strong>Languages:</strong> English is my main spoken language at work nowadays, so I'm a frequent and 
                    confident user, probably the level is C1, but I never took any tests after University, as there was no need. 
                    I also speak and understand basic French (B1), and have basic knowledge of Spanish and Korean.</li>
