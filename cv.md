## CV for RSSchool
1. **Name:** Alisa Pykhova
2. **Contacts:** email: apykhova@gmail.com; mobile/telegram: +79312066110; Skype:tsumiri
3. **Summary:** Last year I've desided that there is a need for change, so I chose to take a new step and become a Front-End developer. This is what amuses me in front-end: you can see the result of your work as soon as you fix or change it. Although my Back-End developer-friends say that 'moving pixels' around is quite boring, I am never bored with this process. It encourages me to learn more and more every day.
4. **Skills:** basic HTM/CSS skills, including Flexbox and Grid, basic JS skills, basic Flutter knowledge
5. **Code example:** [HTML page](https://github.com/TsuShinra/html_course_1/) ; [Tiny flutter test project](https://github.com/TsuShinra/Test_project_for_Leonid/)
6. **Experience:** HTML course project and several layouts I did for fun for my hobby projects
7. **Education:** Got admitted to Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics in 2003, dropped after 1 year, transfering to Sociology faculty, which I succesfully graduated in 2009. After that was working mainly in localization industry, in LogrusIT LLC. Now I plan to move on and return to my long-forgotten programming dreams.
8. **Languages:** English is my main spoken language at work nowadays, so I'm a frequent and confident user, probably the level is C1, but I never took any tests after University, as there was no need. I also speak and understand basic French (B1), and have basic knowledge of Spanish and Korean languages.
